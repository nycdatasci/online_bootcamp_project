Exploratory analysis of the **National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)**, administered by the CDC. A subset of the most recent data results from 2013-2014 including demographic and socioeconomic information, exercise and health information for ~10,000 survey participants is made available for interaction within a shiny application.

Please use the [application](https://thomaskassel.shinyapps.io/nhanes_health_app/) itself, or visit the [blog post](http://blog.nycdatascience.com/student-works/tracking-exercise-trends-nhanes/) for further context.

Possible extensions of this analysis are to build out a "Diet & Nutrition" tab within the app that further examines health outcomes. This tab would utilize underlying tables collected by NHANES including food sources, nutrient intake, dietary supplement and other nutritional information on each subject.
