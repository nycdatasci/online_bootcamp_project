#/r/soccer Team Crest Scraping and Analysis

Reddit soccer subreddit /r/soccer is an enormous community of soccer fans with a subscriber fanbase well over 500,000! In this subreddit, users discuss players, clubs, matches and goal videos posted in near real-time. The anonymity of Reddit provides a powerful tool for users to express their opinions about the clubs they support and also the clubs they don't like. This unique feature prevents the bulding of echo chambers in the discussions with any user free to comment in any of the submissions.

/r/soccer also provides each user the option to select a "flair" which is the team crest of the club the user supports. A miniature crest logo is displayed beside the username in their post submissions and comments in the forum. This gives other users context and insight into the user's thinking and adds another interesting dimension to the conversations that take place.

In this project, my objective is to analyze the fan distribution across the forum. For this purpose, I collect the user-flair mapping for top 500 comments in each of the top 1000 posts during the past one month. With football games occurring on a weekly basis, this data represents a typical activity in the forum. 

For the evaluation, I analyze the Fan diversity through the metrics a) unique team crests per submission and b) percentage share of the biggest fan representation per submission.On one extreme, goal videos tend to have a high diversity in discussion as the quality of goal can transcend a fan's support for a club. In contrast,  match threads which are posts that are intended for discussions of a particular, ongoing match tend to have lower diversity. This is because there is a significant percentage of the comments from fans of the two clubs taking part in the match.  

Moreover, I also analyze the relationship between the fan diversity of a submission with the submission score. Submission score is the difference of upvotes and downvotes from the users resulting in ranking of the various submissions on the subreddit.
